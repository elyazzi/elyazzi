- 👋 Hi, I’m @elyazzi, a student from Southern Finland. 
  Programming/Software Development is a dear hobby of mine that keeps me active even during my darkest times.

- 👀 I’m interested in all things software development. 
  I like to work with convenience scripts (python) and Unity3D (C#).
  I also do music programming with JSFX, ReaScript and C++ with JUCE
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of C++ and JUCE.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are within my skillset

- 📫 You can reach me via email - tyyppilation2@gmail.com
