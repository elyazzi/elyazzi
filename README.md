- 👋 Hi, I’m @elyazzi, a student from Southern Finland. 
  Programming/Software Development is a dear hobby of mine that keeps me active even during my darkest times.

- 👀 I’m interested in all things software development. 
  I like to mess around with automation scripts, but have been involved in serious projects too, mostly helping with Unity3D game development.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of python and tackling whatever interesting problems I have coming my way!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can help with!

- 📫 You can reach me via email - tyyppilation2@gmail.com
